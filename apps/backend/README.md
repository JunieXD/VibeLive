# Local backend

The FastAPI backend follows this dependency direction:

```text
api -> application -> domain
                \--> application ports

providers -------> application ports
infrastructure ---> application ports
```

`bootstrap` creates concrete adapters and injects them into the application layer. Keep provider wire formats and SQLAlchemy models inside their adapters. Audience selection, speaking timing, model-call grouping and memory extraction remain replaceable algorithms and must not be embedded in transport handlers.

See [Backend design](../../docs/BACKEND_DESIGN.md) for module responsibilities, the realtime data lifecycle, SQLite schema, transaction boundaries and migration rules.
